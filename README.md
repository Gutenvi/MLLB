# MLLB
Machine Learning Lab repository of Álvaro Gutiérrez

Last updated: 20/01/2021

In this repository you will find two folders. One for each project of the PRDL and MLLB courses.

**Regarding the mid-term project:** The R Scripts may be a bit more messy than the Python ones, that are separated one by performed activity. R scripts have been more used for investigation and learning the R language, rather than for just developing the project. However, Python notebooks are pretty clean and ready to use.

**Regarding the final-term project** Inside you will find all the Python Notebooks that were used in the project. They are divided into 2 folders: one for the CNN Course and the second for the exercises proposed in PRDL. Also note that in the MLLB report you will find the links to this same notebooks in Google Colab.
