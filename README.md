Machine Learning Lab repository of Álvaro Gutiérrez

Last updated: 06/12/2020

In this repository you will find two folders. One for each coding language used for this project, R and Python.

The R Scripts may be a bit more messy than the Python ones, that are separated one by performed activity. R scripts have been more used for investigation and learning the R language, rather than for just developing the project. However, Python notebooks are pretty clean and ready to use.

Any doubt please write an email to alvaro.gutierrez.tenorio@alumnos.upm.es
